      <!-- about amphibians -->
      <h2>All About Amphibians</h2>
        <p>All amphibians are vertebrates, and they need moist environments or water to survive.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>They are cold-blooded.</li>
          <li>They absorb water and breathe through their thin skin.</li>
          <li>They have at least one special skin gland used for defense.</li>
          <li>Most follow the life cycle of egg-larva-adult.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <!-- about birds -->
      <h2>All About Birds</h2>
        <p>Birds are a type of warm-blooded vertebrate that are adapted to fly.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not all birds can fly, but they do all have wings.</li>
          <li>Birds have beaks that help them catch and swallow food.</li>
          <li>The digestive system of a bird allows it to eat whenever it can and digest the food later.</li>
          <li>Birds lay eggs to reproduce.</li>
          <li>They are endothermic, meaning they maintain their own constant body temperature.</li>
          <li>They are bipedal, which means they have two legs.</li>
          <li>They have hollow bones and their bodies are covered in feathers.</li>
          <li>Birds belong to the class called Aves.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <!-- about mammals -->
      <h2>All About Mammals</h2>
        <p>Mammals are another type of vertebrate that belong to the class Mammalia.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Young mammals get nourishment from milk produced by their mothers.</li>
          <li>Most mammals have hair.</li>
          <li>Their jaw is hinged directly to their skull, unlike all other vertebrates.</li>
          <li>Almost all mammals give birth to live babies.</li>
          <li>They are endothermic, or warm-blooded.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <!-- about fishes -->
      <h2>All About Fish</h2>
        <p>Fish are also vertebrates, and they are considered the oldest-known vertebrates.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>They are ectothermic, or cold-blooded, which means they rely on their surroundings to regulate their body temperature.</li>
          <li>Fish have fins.</li>
          <li>Most, but not all, fish have bodies covered in scales and breathe through gills.</li>
          <li>Fish live underwater.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <!-- about reptiles -->
      <h2>All About Reptiles</h2>
        <p>Reptiles are thought to be the first vertebrates to live completely on land. But, not all reptiles live only on land today.</p>
        <ul>

          <li>They lay eggs to reproduce.</li>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>They are made up of many cells that work together or are multicellular.</li>
          <li>Most, but not all, have tissues, cells that work together in a more complex way.</li>
          <li>Most, but not all, can move.</li>
          <li>There are over 35 phyla of invertebrates.</li>
